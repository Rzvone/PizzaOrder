#Pizza Order Werbsite

##Project Description
This was a team project by that time, as a team we have learned just the basics of WEB development. Throughout this project we managed to create a website for the fictional local pizza joint 'PizzaExpress'.

## Challenges

At that point in time some of the challenges we've encountered were:

  - Styling for different resolutions
  - Storing the form


##Setup
##Backend Setup

  - Access the server directory and afterwards run the command npm install followed by nodemon server.js or npx nodemon server.js to start the backend of the website.
  - You shall be prompted with the following message in the terminal:
![backendSrv](https://github.com/Rzvone/PizzaOrder/assets/110209407/cf022f61-da27-4215-b67f-6ad4458e4995)


##Frontend Setup

  - Open a new terminal and access the client directory and run the command npm install.
  - Access the backend directory and afterwards run the command nodemon server.js or npx nodemon server.js to start the website's interface.
  - If you'll access the http://127.0.0.1:9003/ URL on any browser now you shall be able to access the website.
